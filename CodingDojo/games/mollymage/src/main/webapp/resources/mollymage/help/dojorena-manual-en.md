## Intro

The game server for familiarization and practice you can always find here: 
[MollyMage Free-For-All server](https://dojorena.io/games/1)

This is the open source game. To realize your game, correct errors 
in the current version and make the other corrections, you should 
[fork the project](https://github.com/codenjoyme/codenjoy) at first. 
There is the description in the Readme.md file in the repository root. 
It is specified in the description what to do next.

Game project (for writing your bot) can be found 
[here](https://github.com/codenjoyme/codenjoy-clients.git)

## What's this game about?

Keep in mind: when writing your bot you should stick to its movement logic.
The rest of the game is ready for you.

You should write your bot for the hero who will beat the other bots 
by the score it gets. All bots play on the same field of play. The 
hero can move by idle cells to all four directions.

The hero can plant a potion. The potion will explode in 5 ticks (seconds). 
The blast wave can affect inhabitants of the field. All affected by 
the blast wave disappear. You can decline by both your and someone 
else's potion.

On her/his way, the hero can meet a ghost that destroys all heroes on 
its way.

Each destroyed object on the field (hero, ghost, destroyed walls) is 
restored in an instant in the other place. If the hero is damaged, 
the penalty points[(?)](#ask) are allocated to him.

The hero whose potion destroyed something on the map receives bonus 
points[(?)](#ask) as follows: for the destroyed walls, 
for the ghost, for the enemy hero.

All points are summed up. The player with the largest number of points 
is considered to be a winner (prior to the due date).

## Connect to the server

So, the player registers on the server and joining the game.

Then you should connect from client code to the server via websockets. 
This [collection of clients](https://github.com/codenjoyme/codenjoy-clients.git) 
for different programming languages will help you. How to start a client 
please check at the root of the project in the README.md file.

If you can't find your programming language, you're gonna have to 
write your client (and then send us to the mail:
[oleksandr_baglai@epam.com](mailto:oleksandr_baglai@epam.com)

Address to connect the game on the server looks like this (you can 
copy it from your game room):

`https://[server]/codenjoy-contest/board/player/[user]?code=[code]`

Here `[server]` - domain/id of server, `[user]` is your player id and 
`[code]` is your security token. Make sure you keep the code safe from 
prying eyes. Any participant, knowing your code, can play on your behalf.

## Message format

After connection, the client will regularly (every second) receive 
a line of characters with the encoded state of the field. The format:

`^board=(.*)$`

You can use this regular expression to extract a board from
the resulting string.

## Field example

Here is an example of a string from the server:

<pre>board=☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼ #   # #  #♥#  #  #  &        #☼☼♥☼♥☼♥☼#☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼♥☼ ☼ ☼#☼#☼♥☼#☼#☼☼#♥♥  ♥#   # #♥   # ♥#          ☼☼ ☼ ☼#☼ ☼♥☼ ☼ ☼#☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼&☼ ☼ ☼ ☼☼     ♥          # #            ☼☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼♥☼ ☼ ☼♥☼#☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼☼#       # #       ☺& 2  #  #  #☼☼#☼♥☼ ☼#☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼#☼ ☼ ☼ ☼☼#  # ♥#               # ♥   #  ☼☼ ☼ ☼#☼#☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼#☼ ☼☼   #♥ #      #                 ☼☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼♥☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼#☼☼     ## #     #   # #   ♥      ☼☼ ☼ ☼♥☼ ☼ ☼#☼ ☼#☼ ☼ ☼♥☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼☼       #♥       #      ## # ###☼☼ ☼ ☼ ☼#☼ ☼ ☼#☼ ☼ ☼#☼#☼&☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼☼       #       #    ♣# #     ♥ ☼☼ ☼ ☼ ☼♥☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼#☼ ☼☼        ## ## ♥             # #☼☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼☼                   &    ###  ##☼☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼#☼ ☼#☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼☼                   ♥ ##        ☼☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼♥☼#☼ ☼ ☼ ☼☼     ##         &#         #   ☼☼ ☼ ☼ ☼#☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼#☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼☼   #   #         #     # &     ☼☼♥☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼#☼#☼ ☼☼  #                    ##   &  ☼☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼#☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼ ☼#☼ ☼#☼ ☼☼ #    # &        #       #     ☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼☼</pre>

The line length is equal to the field square. If to insert a wrapping 
character (carriage return) every `sqrt(length(string))` characters, 
you obtain the readable image of the field.

The first character of the line corresponds to a cell located on the 
left-top corner and has the `[0, 32]` coordinate. The following example 
shows the position of the hero (the `☺` character) – `[19,25]`. left-bottom 
corner has the `[0, 0]` coordinate.

## What to do

The game is turn-based: Each second, the server sends the updated state 
of the field to the client and waits for response. Within the next 
second the player must give the molly a command. If no command is 
given, the molly will stand still.

Your goal is to make the molly move according to your algorithm. The 
algorithm must earn points as much as possible. The ultimate goal is 
winning the game.

## Commands

* `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT` - move your hero in the specified direction.
* `ACT` - set a potion.  Also, if you have perk `POTION_REMOTE_CONTROL` - 
  you explode yours RC-potions by second command `ACT` when she needs it. 
* `АСТ,<DIRECTION>`,`<DIRECTION>,АСТ` - movement and `ACT` 
  commands can be combined, separating them by comma. During one game cycle 
  the Molly will set a potion and move. Combinations `LEFT,ACT` or `ACT,LEFT` 
  are different: either we move to the left and plant a potion there, or 
  we plant a potion and run away to the left.
* `ACT(1),<DIRECTION>` - works only with perk `POISON_THROWER`. 
  Molly throws a blast of poison in the specified direction. Order 
  `LEFT,ACT(1)` or `ACT(1),LEFT` - does not matter. 
  Without direction, just command `ACT(1)` nothing will happen - hero just 
  will stay on place.
* `ACT(2)` -  works only with perk `POTION_EXPLODER`. All points on 
  the field are exploding in the next tick. Works on all potions (own, 
  team, enemy, RC). Can be used as a single command and can be combined 
  with Direction. Example: `RIGHT,ACT(2)` - in this case Molly will try 
  to move right and all potions on the field explode. 

## Perks

* `POTION_BLAST_RADIUS_INCREASE` - Increase potion radius blast. 
  `{value: +2, timeout: 30}`[(?)](#ask)
* `POTION_COUNT_INCREASE` - Temporarily increase count of settable potions.
  `{count: +4, timeout: 30}`[(?)](#ask)
* `POTION_REMOTE_CONTROL` - Next several potions would be with 
  remote control. Activating by command `ACT`. `{value:  3}`[(?)](#ask)
* `POTION_IMMUNE` - Temporarily gives you immunity from potion blasts.
  `{timeout: 30}`[(?)](#ask)
* `POISON_THROWER`  Hero can shoot by poison cloud. 
  Using: `ACT(1),<DIRECTION>`. `{timeout: 30}`[(?)](#ask)
* `POTION_EXPLODER`  Hero can explode all potions on the field. 
  Using: `ACT(2)`. `{number of  use: +1, timeout: 30}`[(?)](#ask)

## Cases

* you can combine perks
* who earn points after using `POTION_EXPLODER` - decides Sensei[(?)](#ask).
* please be careful with perks on the field.

## Hints

The first task is to run a client’s WebSocket which will connect to 
the server. Then you should “force” the hero to listen to the commands. 
This is the way prepare yourself to the game. The main goal is to 
play meaningfully and win. 

If you are not sure what to do try to implement the following algorithms:

* Move to a random empty adjacent cell.
* Move to a free cell in the direction of the nearest chest.
* Try to hide from future blasts.
* Avoid ghost and other heroes.
* Try to set the bomb so that it explode the box, ghosts or another heroes.

## FAQ

* I wonder what will happen if two players will try to move their heroes
  on one cell simultaneously? Both mages will die?
  + Someone will move, the second one will stay on its previous place.
* What to do after cloning the javascript client?
  + Information how to start play you can find in the ReadMe.md file.
    You need to fill with your date this file `browser-0-settings.js`.
    And after that run file `browser-2-run.html`. Logic for your bot you need
    to implement in `codenjoy-javascript-client/games/mollymage/solver.js`. 
* What will I see on a client when dead ghost (created after destruction
  of a perk) meet treasure box on his way?
  + Destroyed perks just want to kill you. And he will try to get to you
    in the shortest way possible. If box appear on his way - he'll find
    another way to you.
* It seemed to me that they can destroy treasure boxes on their way
  + I see one thing in the server code, that if the treasure box appeared
    under the ghostHunter - he shows to us as opened treasure box
* Is there a way to get the information about what perks are active for
  the hero or should have to maintain this by ourselves?
  + Only maintain by yourself
* I am not able to find information about how long one perk is active;
  please share the link for the information in case I have missed this.
  + Sometimes it can changes. So here you can get server game settings
    [in json](/codenjoy-contest/rest/settings/player).
* So just wanted to double check - the finals - do we do rounds there? or
  the type of the game like indefinite free for all?
  + Final will be in Rounds with 7-9 heroes per room. The Heroes in the
    rooms will be constantly shuffling. There will be no fixed playgroups.
    Playing fields will also change from round to round.
* Now on map nothing moving - is it working now? Or still under maintenance?
  + Please check, maybe you in another game room. There are demo game flood
    room and event room. Please join in the event room.
* It would be good - if to have some sample code to have
  + Would be. Maybe some tips will help you. Please look into the classes
    which presented in your client. Class Board as usual has some methods
    that can help you analyze field state
* Fore some reason, flying GHOST_DEADs are shown as 'opening treasure boxes',
  is it an issue or I don't understand smth?
  + This is expected; blasting potions create flying ghosts which will find
    shortest path opening treasure to kill you.
* Is it possible for java client to load the local game in browser?
  + Java client could be loaded only from IDE or console. It does not have
    browser version. Only JS client has web version.
* I'm interested how the final would be conducted... Do we need to reconnect
  to the same server or other server? Or the score would be skipped and all
  connections would be saved?There is a risk that I could be absent at the
  moment, and would like to participate and look who's bot is the most
  successful. So I would like to plan my steps.
  + It will be in the same room. You need to play like you played before.
    The finale will begin with the room resetting points for all players. That's all.
* How to combine in JS both `ACT` and `LEFT`?
  + `return [Direction.ACT, Direction.LEFT];`

## <a id="ask"></a> Ask Sensei

You can always see the settings of the current game
[here](/codenjoy-contest/rest/settings/player).
Please ask Sensei about current game settings. You can find Sensei in
the chat that the organizers have provided to discuss issues.

## Clients and API

The client code does not give a considerable handicap to gamers because
you should spend time to puzzle out the code. However, it is pleasant
to note that the logic of communication with the server plus some high
level API for working with the board are implemented already.

* `Solver`
  An empty class with one method — you'll have to fill it with smart logic.
* `Direcion`
  Possible commands for this game.
* `Point`
  `x`, `y` coordinates.
* `Element`
  Type of the element on the board.
* `Board`
  Еncapsulating the line with useful methods for searching
  elements on the board. The following methods can be found in the board:
* `int boardSize();`
  Size of the board
* `boolean isAt(Point point, Element element);`
  Whether the given element has given coordinate?
* `boolean isAt(Point point, Collection<Element>elements);`
