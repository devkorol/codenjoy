## What's this game about?

Keep in mind: when writing your bot you should stick to its movement logic.
The rest of the game is ready for you.

You should write your bot for the hero who will beat the other bots 
by the score it gets. All bots play on the same field of play. The 
hero can move by idle cells to all four directions.

The hero can plant a potion. The potion will explode in 5 ticks (seconds). 
The blast wave can affect inhabitants of the field. All affected by 
the blast wave disappear. You can decline by both your and someone 
else's potion.

On her/his way, the hero can meet a ghost that destroys all heroes on 
its way.

Each destroyed object on the field (hero, ghost, destroyed walls) is 
restored in an instant in the other place. If the hero is damaged, 
the penalty points[(?)](#ask) are allocated to him.

The hero whose potion destroyed something on the map receives bonus 
points[(?)](#ask) as follows: for the destroyed walls, 
for the ghost, for the enemy hero.

All points are summed up. The player with the largest number of points 
is considered to be a winner (prior to the due date).
